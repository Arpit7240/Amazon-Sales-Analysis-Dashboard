# Amazon-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard Tableau
The Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the sales performance across different regions, sales channels, and product categories. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders monitor key metrics such as total revenue, profit, average shipment days, and units sold. It enables data-driven decision-making by offering insights into regional performance, sales trends over time, and the impact of shipment delays on revenue.


Useful Insights:
Total Performance: The dashboard shows a total profit of $191M and total revenue of $605.2M, with 1.6M units sold. Average shipment days are 23.55, which might be a factor to watch in improving efficiency.

Regional Analysis: North America and India are the top-performing regions with profits of $225.41M and $190.92M, respectively. This indicates strong market penetration and customer base in these areas.

Sales Channel Analysis: Offline sales account for the majority of the revenue ($433.65M), suggesting that physical stores still play a crucial role in sales despite the rise of e-commerce.

Revenue & Shipment Days: A notable insight is that revenue tends to drop if shipment days increase. This emphasizes the need to streamline logistics to maintain high revenue levels.

Item Category Analysis: Cosmetics and Office Supplies are the highest revenue-generating categories, with $724.38M and $530.62M, respectively. Cosmetics also lead in profit generation, highlighting them as key drivers of overall profitability.

Yearly Trends: The data reveals a revenue increase in 2011, followed by a drop from 2012 to 2015, and then stagnation from 2015 to 2017. This trend indicates potential areas for improvement in maintaining consistent growth.

Cost vs. Profit Analysis: While some categories like Cosmetics and Clothes have high revenue, their profit margins vary, suggesting a need for cost management strategies in lower-margin categories.
